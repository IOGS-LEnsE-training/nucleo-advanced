Signal Processing / Real-time FFT
#################################

The **Fast Fourier Transform** (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sampled signal. By breaking down a signal into its constituent frequencies, FFT enables analysis and processing in various fields such as signal processing, communications, and image processing.

It transforms a signal from its time (or spatial - for images) domain into the frequency domain. It accomplishes this by recursively dividing the DFT into smaller DFTs, significantly reducing computation time compared to the standard DFT calculation, making it a fundamental tool for spectral analysis and signal processing applications.
